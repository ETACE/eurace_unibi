# Installation

## 1. Prepare system requirements

Make sure to have `cunit` and `gsl` installed.
- On Debian-based systems: `sudo apt-get install libcunit1 libcunit1-doc libcunit1-dev libgsl-dev`.
- On macOS: `brew install cunit gsl`.
- On Windows (TODO: test on appveyor): `TODO`.

## 2. Install libmboard

On top of the repo root directory, download libmboard master version
(https://github.com/FLAME-HPC/libmboard/archive/master.zip has more
bugfixes since 0.3.1) and unzip it

```bash
mkdir libmboard
cd libmboard-master
./autogen.sh
# Remove --disable-parallel if you have mpi installed
./configure --prefix=$(cd ../libmboard; pwd) --disable-parallel
make
make install
cd .. # back to the repo root directory
```

## 3. Install xparser and generate makefile for the model

Download xparser 0.17.1 (https://github.com/FLAME-HPC/xparser/archive/0.17.1.tar.gz) and
extract to xparser/ directory on top of the repo root directory.
```bash
cd xparser
make
./xparser ../eurace_model.xml
cd ..
```

## 4. Build the model

Be sure to replace LIBMBOARD_DIR in Makefile from `/usr/local` to
`$(PWD)/libmboard`.
Finally, run `make`, which should compile everything if the previous steps are
executed correctly.
