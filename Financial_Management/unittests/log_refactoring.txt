out: bankruptcy_message
removed XML condition
Add C Condition:
if (BANKRUPTCY_IDLE_COUNTER%20==0)

		nr_rescalings_left = (double)(BANKRUPTCY_IDLE_COUNTER/20);

- target_debt is a rescaling of total asset
target_debt = DEBT_RESCALING_FACTOR*TOTAL_ASSETS;

- rescale once per month: equal portion write_offs
write_off_ratio = (1/nr_rescalings_left)*(TOTAL_DEBT - target_debt)/TOTAL_DEBT;

Firm_bankruptcy_illiquidity_procedure()
out: bankruptcy_message
removed XML condition
Add C Condition:

		target_debt = DEBT_RESCALING_FACTOR*TOTAL_DEBT;

- rescale once per month: equal portion write_offs
write_off_ratio = (1/nr_rescalings_left)*(TOTAL_DEBT - target_debt)/TOTAL_DEBT;
Test: write_off_ratio =  (1/nr_rescalings_left)*(1-w)
